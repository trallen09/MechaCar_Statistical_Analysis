# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Coefficients:
     (Intercept)    vehicle_length    vehicle_weight     spoiler_angle  ground_clearance               AWD  
      -1.040e+02         6.267e+00         1.245e-03         6.877e-02         3.546e+00        -3.411e+00 
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - 
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
